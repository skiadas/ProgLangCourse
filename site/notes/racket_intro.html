<h1 id="introduction-to-racket">Introduction to Racket</h1>
<p><a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> is a programming language that has evolved from Scheme and Lisp. It has both a statically-typed and a dynamically-typed version, but we will focus on the dynamically-typed version (i.e. there is no type-checking that occurs at “compile time”). There is extensive <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/">online documentation</a> that you should familiarize yourself with.</p>
<h2 id="atoms-and-s-expressions">Atoms and S-expressions</h2>
<p>At its core Racket is a very simple language. There are essentially two ways you can form expressions in the language: atoms and s-expressions.</p>
<p>An <strong>atom</strong> is a single quantity. They are also called <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/Simple_Values.html">simple values</a>. Typical examples would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/numbers.html">Numbers</a>. Racket has various kinds of numbers, both “exact” (fractions, integers, complex numbers) and “inexact” (floating point).</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/booleans.html">Booleans</a> are denoted by <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>. Also in general every value but <code>#f</code> is treated as “falsy”.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/strings.html">Strings</a> are as usual surrounded by double quotes.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/symbols.html">Symbols</a> are a not typically seen kind of value. They start with a single quote, followed by alphanumerics. Symbols are not like strings. Think of them as fields/keys. Testing for symbol equality is quick, but there are not many other operations you can perform on symbols.</li>
<li>There are other atoms that we will not look at.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost everything else in Racket is an <strong>s-expression</strong>, though that is not how they are referred to in the language. Such an expression consists of a list of other atoms or expressions, surrounded in parentheses. It is invariably the case that the expression is interpreted as a the first argument, a function or operator, applied to the remaining arguments. For instance addition of numbers would be denoted as <code>(+ 2 3 4)</code>.</p>
<p>Some people find an overabundance of parentheses disruptive; In fact every parenthesis is needed, and there are no ambiguities about the meaning of an expression. For instance we don’t need anyone to disambiguate for us the meaning of <code>2 + 3 * 4</code> because it would be written in Racket as <code>(+ 2 (* 3 4))</code>, as opposed to <code>(* (+ 2 3) 4)</code> if multiplication was meant to occur first. <em>Parsing a Racket program is trivial</em>.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you use vertical alignment as much as possible to indicate grouping. For instance the above expression would often be written as:</p>
<pre><code>(+ 2
   (* 3 4))</code></pre>
<p>where we have vertically aligned the <code>2</code> with the other terms to be added. Here’s how a conditional might work:</p>
<pre><code>(if (&gt; 3 2)
    &quot;The &#39;then&#39; branch&quot;
    &quot;The &#39;else&#39; branch&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Or here is a list of pairs, where the first element in each pair is a symbol. Pairs are formed using <code>cons</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(list (cons &#39;a 2) (cons &#39;b 3) (cons &#39;c 1))</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-working-environment">The working environment</h2>
<p>We will be working in DrRacket, which offers a console next to a document editor. The document editor is typically used to write definitions and “load” those definitions in. The console is used for more interaction.</p>
<p>You will notice the first line in the document is <code>#lang racket</code>. This specifies that we should use the non-statically-typed Racket. There are many other “languages” that can be used in this environment. For example there is a language <code>plai</code> focusing on programming language interpretation. The first line in the file suggests what language is to be used to interpret the rest of the file.</p>
<p>While we are at it, comments in Racket start with a semicolon, and go to the end of the line. One often uses two semicolons for longer and more permanent comments. There are no block comments available.</p>
<p>As you type in the document editor you will see that sections are highlighted when you close a parenthesis, to help you know what you have closed.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>There are a number of different ways to create definitions. The most standard is the <code>define</code> macro. We will see more later.</p>
<p>The simplest form of <code>define</code> would be:</p>
<pre><code>(define a 5)</code></pre>
<p>From now on <code>a</code> stands for <code>5</code>. We can also use this to define functions, using the anonymous function construct in Racket, called <code>lambda</code> instead of <code>fun</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(define add3 (lambda (x) (+ x 3)))
(add3 5)</code></pre>
<p>We would most often space the definition vertically, like so:</p>
<pre><code>(define add3
  (lambda (x)
    (+ x 3)))</code></pre>
<p>So let us examine the form of a <code>lambda</code> expression: The second item is a parenthesized list of the variable names, in this case only one such name <code>x</code>, and the third item is the body of the function. The first item is of course the keyword <code>lambda</code>.</p>
<p>Definitions done via <code>define</code> are visible throughout the file. In particular, they are automatically set for recursion. We can therefore do the following, for example, to add all numbers up to <code>n</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(define addUp
  (lambda (n)
    (if (&lt;= n 0)
        0
        (+ n (addUp (- n 1))))))</code></pre>
<p>There is a “syntactic sugar” for the function definition, that would make the above look as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(define (addUp n)
  (if (&lt;= n 0)
      0
      (+ n (addUp (- n 1)))))</code></pre>
<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
<p>Lists are a crucial structure in Racket. They are formed essentially as a sequence of “pairs” terminating with <code>null</code>. There is no separate notion of pairs as in tuples. You can simply “pair” two values together via <code>cons</code>, and if you do this systematically where the second value in the pair is always a list you get lists. For example the following are equivalent ways of specifying a list:</p>
<pre><code>(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 null)))
(list 1 2 3)</code></pre>
<p>There are three operations that we can perform on lists:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>null?</code> tells us if the list is empty. For instance <code>(null? (list 1 2 3))</code> will return false, while <code>(null? null)</code> will return true.</li>
<li><p><code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> are used on any kind of pair to give us the first and second entry in the pair. For instance we have the following:</p>
<pre><code>(define l (list 1 2 3))
(car l)         ;; returns 1
(cdr l)         ;; returns the list &#39;(2 3)
(car (cdr l))   ;; returns 2</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>For example here is a function that adds up all elements in a list:</p>
<pre><code>(define sum-list
  (lambda (xs)
    (if (null? xs)
        0
        (+ (car xs)
           (sum-list (cdr xs))))))
(sum-list l)         ;; should return 6</code></pre>
<h2 id="practice-problems">Practice problems</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write a function <code>multUp</code> that given a positive integer <code>n</code> multiplies all the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>fib</code> that computes the <code>n</code>-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci numbers start with the 0th and 1st number equaling <code>1</code>, and every subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. Do not worry about efficiency.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>lookup</code> that takes as input a list of symbol-number pairs and also a symbol and looks that symbol up in the list. If it finds it then it returns the corresponding number, otherwise it returns <code>#f</code>. You can compare two symbols using <code>eq?</code>. An example use would be that <code>(lookup (list (cons 'a 2) (cons 'b 3)) 'b)</code> should return <code>3</code>.</li>
<li>Write a version of <code>lookup</code> that allows for the possibility that an entry in the list is not a pair at all. It should simply skip those entries. You can use <code>pair?</code> to test if something is a pair, and <code>not</code> to negate. An example use would be: <code>(lookup (list (cons 'a 2) 45 (cons 'b 3)) 'b)</code></li>
<li>Read up on <code>cond</code> on <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/conditionals.html#%28part._cond%29">the documentation</a> and use it to simplify the previous function.</li>
<li>Write a function <code>max</code> that given a list of numbers returns the largest number. If the list is empty then it should return <code>(error &quot;empty list&quot;)</code>.</li>
</ol>
