<h1 id="interpreting-with-type-inference">Interpreting with Type Inference</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Type inference, as opposed to type-checking aims at inferring the type of variables and functions from the restrictions imposed on them by the code. In order to achieve that it implements a so-called “unification” algorithm, that we saw earlier in the course and will now revisit.</p>
<p>Let us start by reviewing the language that we will consider:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(struct varC (s) #:transparent)
(struct numC (n) #:transparent)
(struct boolC (b) #:transparent)
(struct arithC (op e1 e2) #:transparent)
(struct ifC (tst thn els) #:transparent)
(struct pairC (e1 e2) #:transparent)
(struct carC (e) #:transparent)
(struct cdrC (e) #:transparent)
(struct unitC () #:transparent)
(struct letC (s e1 e2) #:transparent)
(struct funC (fname arg ty-arg body ty-body) #:transparent)
(struct callC (e1 e2) #:transparent)</code></pre>
<p>The goal of the type-checker and type-inferer is to associate a type with each expression. We therefore need to decide what types we would have. We did that already when we looked at how to implement a type-checker. What is now different is that we need to implement a couple of new types.</p>
<ul>
<li>One is a “variable” type. This is a type that not known yet, and needs to be determined, or a type that is hidden behind a polymorphic type, that we’ll discuss in a moment. Variable types will simply be indexed 1, 2, 3, …, so they’ll contain an integer in them. We will have a function <code>(new-type)</code> that increments the variable type counter and returns a new variable type, like our store location worked.</li>
<li>The other is polymorphic types. We will elaborate on these later.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="racket"><code>(struct numT () #:transparent)
(struct boolT () #:transparent)
(struct unitT () #:transparent)
(struct pairT (t1 t2) #:transparent)
(struct funT (t1 t2) #:transparent)    ;; t1 -&gt; t2
(struct varT (i) #:transparent)     ;; X1, X2, X3
(struct polyT (tvar texpr) #:transparent)</code></pre>
<p>The main typecheck method is split in two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constraint generation: This takes as input an expression and a static environment, and it returns a pair of a type and a list of constraints. The type is the computed type of the expression. It’s a concrete type if it can be determined right away, or it’s some sort of variable type otherwise. The constraints are a list of pairs of types, the understanding being that those pairs MUST be equal for the typechecking to succeed. As the constraint generator recursively calls other parts, it collects these constraints together to a total set of constraints. We will use a struct <code>t*c</code> for the return values of the constraint generator.</li>
<li>Unification: The unification process goes through the list of constraints, and tries to solve them, via the process known as “unification”. It basically goes through each pair and either finds a contradiction (a <code>numT</code> that’s supposed to also be a <code>boolT</code>) or it learns a new correspondence (this <code>varT 5</code> is supposed to be a <code>boolT</code>) and then uses that substitution in the rest of the constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>So our main typechecker would look something like this:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(struct t*c (t c))    ;; The constraint generator return type

(define (typecheck env e)
  (let* ([constr (gen-con env e)]
         [unif (unify (t*c-c constr))])
    (subst-type (t*c-t constr) unif)))</code></pre>
<h2 id="constraint-generation">Constraint Generation</h2>
<p>We will focus first on the constraint generation part. For type of each expression it needs to create a pair of the type of the expression and any constraints. So it will be our usual big <code>cond</code>:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (gen-con env e)
  (cond
    [(numC? e)
     (t*c (numT) null)]
    [(varC? e)
     (t*c (lookup (varC-s e) env)
           null)]
    [(boolC? e)
     (t*c (boolT) null)]
    [(unitC? e)
     (t*c (unitT) null)]
    ...
    ))</code></pre>
<p>The standard values don’t take much. Pairs are going to be just a tad harder.</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>    ;; (struct pairC (e1 e2))
    [(pairC? e)
     (let ([r1 (gen-con env (pairC-e1 e))]
           [r2 (gen-con env (pairC-e2 e))])
       (t*c (pairT (t*c-t r1) (t*c-t r2))
            (append (t*c-c r1) (t*c-c r2))))]</code></pre>
<p>The conditional is equally straightforward. Remember that in normal typechecking we required that the conditional is a boolean and that the two branches have the same type. Instead of throwing an error if they don’t, we now add these statements as constraints:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>    ;; (struct ifC (tst thn els))
    [(ifC? e)
     (let ([r1 (gen-con env (ifC-tst e))]
           [r2 (gen-con env (ifC-thn e))]
           [r3 (gen-con env (ifC-els e))])
       (t*c (t*c-t r2)
            (list* (cons (t*c-t r1) (boolT))
                   (cons (t*c-t r2) (t*c-t r3))
                   (append (t*c-c r1) (t*c-c r2) (t*c-c r3)))))]</code></pre>
<p>We will next deal with arithmetic operators. They are similar:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>    ;; (struct arithC (op e1 e2))
    [(arithC? e)
     (let ([r1 (gen-con env (arithC-e1 e))]
           [r2 (gen-con env (arithC-e2 e))])
       (t*c (numT)
            (list* (cons (t*c-t r1) (numT))
                   (cons (t*c-t r2) (numT))
                   (append (t*c-c r1) (t*c-c r2)))))]</code></pre>
<p>Next we will consider <code>carC</code>. This one is somewhat tricky. Normally we would compute the type of its component, then require that type to be a <code>pairT</code>. We can try to do the same, but the type doesn’t have to literally be a <code>pairT</code>. It could be for example some variable type <code>varT 6</code> that only after a lot of future work ends up being <code>pairT</code>. We can’t wait for that, we need to impose our constraints now.</p>
<p>We really don’t have many available options: We must create a new <code>pairT</code> type, with two newly created variable types as its components, then add the appropriate constraints. We will add an extra optimization. In the event where the type of the subexpression is indeed a <code>pairT</code> type, we don’t need to create new types.</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>    ;; (struct carC (e))
    [(carC? e)
     (let* ([r (gen-con env (carC-e e))]
            [ty-e (if (pairT? (t*c-t r))
                      (t*c-t r)
                      (pairT (new-type) (new-type)))])
       (t*c (pairT-t1 ty-e)
            (list* (cons (t*c-t r) ty-e)
                   (t*c-c r))))]</code></pre>
<p>Of course, <code>cdrC</code> is similar. Let statements are straightforward, for now:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>    ;; (struct letC (s e1 e2))
    [(letC? e)
     (let* ([r1 (gen-con env (letC-e1 e))]
            [r2 (gen-con (bind (letC-s e) (t*c-t r1) env)
                         (letC-e2 e))])
       (t*c (t*c-t r2)
            (append (t*c-c r1) (t*c-c r2))))]</code></pre>
<p>Calls are a bit like <code>carC</code>. They expect the first argument to be a function type. If it is not, they need to build a new function type to use in its place.</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>    ;; (struct callC (e1 e2))
    [(callC? e)
     (let* ([r1 (gen-con env (callC-e1 e))]
            [r2 (gen-con env (callC-e2 e))]
            [ty-f (if (funT? (t*c-t r1))
                      (t*c-t r1)
                      (funT (new-type) (new-type)))])
       (t*c (funT-t2 ty-f)
            (list* (cons (funT-t1 ty-f) (t*c-t r2))
                   (append (t*c-c r1) (t*c-c r2)))))]</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, our function definitions. If they have provided us with a type for the argument, we must use that, otherwise create a new type variable. Same with the return type (<code>ty-body</code>).</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>    ;; (struct funC (fname arg ty-arg body ty-body))
    [(funC? e)
     (let* ([targ (or (funC-ty-arg e) (new-type))]
            [tbody (or (funC-ty-body e) (new-type))]
            [env1 (bind (funC-arg e) targ env)]
            [env2 (if (funC-fname e)
                      (bind (funC-fname e) (funT targ tbody) env1)
                      env1)]
            [r (gen-con env2 (funC-body e))])
       (t*c (funT targ tbody)
            (list* (cons tbody (t*c-t r))
                   (t*c-c r))))]</code></pre>
<p>Phew. Let’s look at an example. Consider for instance the following program:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>;; ex1 is function: f(x) = x + 2 called on 10
(define ex1
  (callC (funC #f &#39;x #f
               (arithC + (varC &#39;x) (numC 2)) #f)
         (numC 10)))</code></pre>
<p>It defines a simple non-recursive function that adds 2 to its parameter, then calls it on 10. Let us look at the constraints generated:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(list
  (cons (varT 1) (numT))   ;; callC-e1 arg type must match callC-e2 type
  (cons (varT 2) (numT))   ;; funC-ty-body must match body&#39;s type of numT
  (cons (varT 1) (numT))   ;; arithC-e1 must be numT
  (cons (numT) (numT)))    ;; arithC-e2 must be numT</code></pre>
<p>This concludes our first pass on constraint generation. We will need to revisit some ideas when we discuss polymorphic types.</p>
<h2 id="unification">Unification</h2>
<p>During unification we must look at the list of constraints and determine what they tell us about our types. The work roughly consists of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we have two primitive types, they better be the same.</li>
<li>If we have two non-primitive types (pair, function), they better be the same kind and their parts better unify.</li>
<li>If we have a variable type on one side, then:
<ul>
<li>If we have the same type on the other side, then we don’t learn anything, just move on.</li>
<li>If we have a “safe” type on the other side (not containing the first variable type) then we learned a new “substitution”: Add it to our return dictionary and substitute in the rest of the clauses.</li>
<li>If we have a type on the other side that somehow contains the first variable type, this is an error.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Everything else is an error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us start building this function:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (unify constrs)
  (if (null? constrs)
      null
      (let* ([nxt (car constrs)]
             [t1 (car nxt)]
             [t2 (cdr nxt)]
             [rst (cdr constrs)])
        (cond
          [(and (boolT? t1) (boolT? t2))
           (unify rst)]
          [(and (numT? t1) (numT? t2))
           (unify rst)]
          [(and (unitT? t1) (unitT? t2))]
          ...
          [else (error &quot;Types don&#39;t match&quot;)]
          ))))</code></pre>
<p>If there are no constraints left then we can return an empty list of substitutions. Otherwise we must do something with the next constraint. The atomic types must match.</p>
<p>Next up we have <code>pairT</code>. It must instead expect that the corresponding components match, so we add those in the list of constraints.</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>          [(and (pairT? t1) (pairT? t2))
           (unify (list* (cons (pairT-t1 t1) (pairT-t1 t2))
                         (cons (pairT-t2 t1) (pairT-t2 t2))
                         rst))]</code></pre>
<p>Notice that this seemingly increases the number of constraints by 1. But it also <em>simplifies</em> those constraints. Functions are similar. Lastly, we have the case of variables.</p>
<p>We now are left with the cases where one of the two types is a variable type. If the other one is also a variable type, then either they are the same and we can ignore the constraint, or they are different, in which case we learn a new substitution, of say the first type for the second. We then add that to our return value, and continue unifying the remaining constraints, substituting the first type for the second throughout:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>          [(and (varT? t1) (varT? t2))
           (if (equal? (varT-i t1) (varT-i t2))
               (unify rst)
               (list* (cons t1 t2)
                      (unify (subst-all t1 t2 rst))))]</code></pre>
<p>This requires that we implement the <code>subst-all</code> function. It takes a type and another type, and a list of constraints, and it substitutes the first type with the second throughout. What is left is a set of costraints that do not contain the first type. We will take advantage of Racket’s flexibility here and implement a function that handles any combination of cells containing types. The big conditional has a couple of cases to handle the recursion, then deals with the various recursive types. Every atomic type just stays itself.</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (subst-all t1 t2 els)
  (cond [(null? els) null]
        [(pair? els) (cons (subst-all t1 t2 (car els))
                           (subst-all t1 t2 (cdr els)))]
        [(equal? t1 els) t2]
        [(pairT? els) (pairT (subst-all t1 t2 (pairT-t1 els))
                             (subst-all t1 t2 (pairT-t2 els)))]
        [(funT? els) (funT (subst-all t1 t2 (funT-t1 els))
                           (subst-all t1 t2 (funT-t2 els)))]
        [else els]))</code></pre>
<p>Back to our constraint unification, if the second type is a variable type and the first isn’t, then we simply flip the sides and call ourselves:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>          [(varT? t2)
           (unify (list* (cons t2 t1)
                         rst))]</code></pre>
<p>All that remains will then be the case where the first type is a variable type and the second isn’t. We need to check if the second type contains the first in it. If it does, this is an error in the constraints. Otherwise we’ve learned a new substitution:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>          [(varT? t1)
           (if (contained t1 t2)
               (error &quot;Type contained in itself&quot;)
               (list* (cons t1 t2)
                      (unify (subst-all t1 t2 rst))))]</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>contained</code> is rather straightforward:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (contained t1 t2)
  (cond [(equal? t1 t2) #t]
        [(pairT? t2) (or (contained t1 (pairT-t1 t2))
                         (contained t1 (pairT-t2 t2)))]
        [(funT? t2) (or (contained t1 (funT-t1 t2))
                        (contained t1 (funT-t2 t2)))]
        [else #f]))</code></pre>
<p>This is almost the end of our unification algorithm! What it does is take a list of constraints, and turn it into a list of “substitutions”, where each substitution has a variable on the left and its “result” on the right.</p>
<p>What is missing is a back-substitution step. To explain the need for it, let us look at another example:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define ex2
  (funC #f &#39;x #f
        (arithC + (carC (varC &#39;x)) (cdrC (varC &#39;x)))
        #f))</code></pre>
<p>This function expects a pair as input, and simply adds its two components. Here’s what the list of constraints looks like:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>;; Return type is: (funT (varT 1) (varT 2))
(list
  (cons (varT 2) (numT))        ;; arithC / function body return is numT
  (cons (varT 3) (numT))        ;; arithC-e2 needs to be numT
  (cons (varT 6) (numT))        ;; arithC-e2 needs to be numT
  (cons (varT 1)
        (pairT (varT 3) (varT 4)))     ;; carC needs a pair
  (cons (varT 1)
        (pairT (varT 5) (varT 6)))))   ;; cdrC needs a pair</code></pre>
<p>The unification process results in the following substitutions:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(list
  (cons (varT 2) (numT))
  (cons (varT 3) (numT))
  (cons (varT 6) (numT))
  (cons (varT 1)
        (pairT (numT) (varT 4)))
  (cons (varT 5) (numT))
  (cons (varT 4) (numT)))</code></pre>
<p>Note that when we learned that <code>varT 1</code> is a pair we only knew the value of the first part of that pair, the second part would only come later. But we’ve already committed to a substitution for <code>varT 1</code> at that point. What we need to do now is back-substitution: Any variable that is defined later in the list may appear in the substitution of a variable somewhere earlier. The other way around is not possible as when we established a new substitution we also performed that substitution in all yet-unresolved constraints. We can do this via a foldr:</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (back-sub subs)
  (foldr (lambda (sub rest)
           (list* (cons (car sub)
                        (subst-type (cdr sub) rest))
                  rest))
         &#39;()
         subs))</code></pre>
<p>where the <code>subst-type</code> function is a function that we need to write, which takes a type and a list of substitutions and performs those substitutions on the type.</p>
<pre class="racket"><code>(define (subst-type type subs)
  (cond [(pairT? type) (pairT (subst-type (pairT-t1 type) subs)
                              (subst-type (pairT-t2 type) subs))]
        [(funT? type) (funT (subst-type (funT-t1 type) subs)
                            (subst-type (funT-t2 type) subs))]
        [(varT? type)
         (let ([pr (assoc type subs)])
           (if pr (cdr pr) type))]
        [else type]))</code></pre>
<h2 id="polymorphic-types">Polymorphic Types</h2>
<p>WORK IN PROGRESS</p>
<p>Polymorphic types work as follows: Let us say we have the type <code>'a --&gt; 'a</code> where <code>'a</code> is to be a polymorphic type. To begin with this will look like <code>(funT (varT 5) (varT 5))</code>. To indicate that this variable type <code>varT</code> is to be polymorphic, we create a “polyT” type that has with it the type <code>varT 5</code> as a first argument and the whole function type as a second argument. So it would look like: <code>(polyT (varT 5) (funT (varT 5) (varT 5)))</code>, which basically says “treat <code>varT 5</code> as polymorphic when you consider that function type”. When we want to use a polymorphic type, we must “instantiate it”, meaning that we must create a new fresh variable and replace all occurences of the polymorphic type, <code>varT 5</code> in that example, to this fresh variable. - To go with this,</p>
